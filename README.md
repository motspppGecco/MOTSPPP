## Multiobjective Optimization Project

# This repository contains the organization of implementations, instances, and results obtained from various multiobjective optimization algorithms. The repository structure is organized into the following main folders:

## Project Structure

# implemented_codes
This folder contains the developed algorithms used to solve multiobjective optimization problems. Each algorithm is organized into subfolders:

    moead/ - Implementation of the MOEA/D algorithm.
    nh1/ - Implementation of the NH1 algorithm.
    nh2/ - Implementation of the NH2 algorithm.
    nsga2/ - Implementation of the NSGA-II algorithm.
    solver/ - Implementation of a generic solver for problem-solving.

# instances
This folder contains the test instances used in the experiments. Each instance belongs to group A1 and is subdivided into:

    sym/ - Contains symmetric instances.
    asym/ - Contains asymmetric instances.

# results
This folder stores the results generated by each algorithm for the test instances. The organization is by algorithm, as listed below:

    moead/
    nh1/
    nh2/
    nsga2/
    solver/

# Within each algorithm folder, the following structure is used:

    data/ - Contains execution results organized into:
    a1/ - Contains results processed for instances in group A1.
    asym/ - Results of the asymmetric instances.
    sym/ - Results of the symmetric instances.

# Usage Instructions
Each algorithm can be executed according to the configurations defined in the source codes within the implemented_codes folder. Processed results for each algorithm are organized as described above, allowing for comparative analysis of the results.
